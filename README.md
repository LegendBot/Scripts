LegendSeries Introduction;
================
LegendSeries is an amazing collection of scripts created and provided by;

 - **[Pain][1]** 
 - **[Turtlebot][2]**

We aim to create the best content for *[Bot Of Legends'][13]* users. We understand that there is no single amazing script but what we do understand is that a good variation in scripts is just what you need. Both of us are dedicated to these scripts and we will keep them updated for free for as long as the LegendSeries lives.

Instructions;
=============
 1. Ensure that you have all of the [Libraries][14] in your /Common/ folder before using our [Scripts][15].
 2. Launch a Custom Game in League of Legends before playing against live people, we are not responsible  for any losses that occure in your game(s).
 4. Play against bots or friends until you are satisfied with the results of the script.
 5. Once you're ready, feel free to play against human players in normals or ranked.

Scripts;
=======
*Disclaimer: If a script in our repository is not linked here, I urge you to not use that script as it may be going through a test phase and cause errors for you.*

Libraries;
